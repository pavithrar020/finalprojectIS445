Professor Uhe

IS 445 - Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class:
My biggest takeaway from this class was cleaning data in CSV’s before using them as well as learning how to manipulate data for visualizations that are “bluffing” as well as not. It was cool to see the other side of how data visualizations could be skewed or biased to show a certain narrative, and now that I am aware of that I can try to see trends in visualizations in the future and see if it is logical. I had a hard time using bad CSV’s to make data visualizations in the past but this class taught me how easy it is to clean up the CSV beforehand and have a smoother process in coding the visualizations. I will be using these skills in the future!

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher:
Professor Uhe was an engaging Professor for me. I enjoyed every class, he knew how to make things interesting. I especially liked it when he showed us real-life use cases of data visualization in a work setting. I also liked coding in class while he taught us on the side how to do so. I think in the future more of such classes, where he teaches us coding while we code would be helpful. I also think that it would be interesting to show how to code cool and challenging visualizations so that students can have practice before the final project. Overall, solid class and Professor!
